I started work on trying to make a clean interface to decaf which can be used for debuggers as part of some refactoring work around the imgui based debugger.<br>

Disney Epic Mickey 2 going ingame, albeit at an incredibly low FPS.<br>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><a href="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2019/12/2019-02-08_09-59-40.jpg"><img src="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2019/12/2019-02-08_09-59-40.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="History of decaf-emu in screenshots - Part 7"></a></figure></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><strong>2019-08-18</strong><br>
Around this time I started working on the Qt based debugger, this would be using the same debug interface to decaf that I worked on earlier whilst refactoring the imgui debugger.</p>
<p>
The motivation for writing a debugger in Qt was so that we could move rendering of the debugger out of the game window. This was because we were using two Vulkans graphics queues in order to render, one which was responsible for rendering the imgui overlay and the game screens, and one which was used for running the graphics backend. The graphics backend would draw frames as fast as the game provided it, and the display would be running independently at 60 fps just drawing the most recent frame produced by the backend.</p>
<p>
Unfortunately it turns out that AMD graphics drivers only support having one Vulkan graphics queue, this would make it difficult to continue with this model of rendering. So I decided that we should move the display to the graphics backend and consequently we would need a replacement for the imgui debugger, as there is no point in a debugger which is tied to the games frame rate.</p>

Mario Kart 8 is finally running in game again, albeit still ugly as ever. One of the causes of ugliness is the current lack of mipmap support.<br>

I do actually use the debugger some times, so maybe it was worth the effort. Here I am stepping through some code in the Internet Browser.<br>

There was an open pull request on decaf for a long time implementing a game list. I eventually got around to tackling it, but unfortunately ended up rewriting most of the code.</p>
<p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><a href="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2019/12/2019-11-07_14-16-35.png"><img src="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2019/12/2019-11-07_14-16-35.png" class="kg-image" alt="History of decaf-emu in screenshots - Part 7"></a></figure></p>
<p>This is what a icon list view looks like in Qt by default. I am not sure why anyone would prefer it to behave like this as opposed to neatly ordering. Rest assured the actual icon view looks nicer than this one.</p>
<p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><a href="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2019/12/2019-11-07_15-03-45.jpg"><img src="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2019/12/2019-11-07_15-03-45.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="History of decaf-emu in screenshots - Part 7"></a></figure></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><strong>2019-11-09</strong><br>
So it turns out the decaf-emu svg logo we had that someone made for us a long time ago (sorry I forgot who), was not a real vectorised svg but instead a series of PNG files embedded inside a svg file - which is kind of pointless when you think about it really.</p>
<p>So I spent the day learning how to use inkscape (in terms of UX, you get what you pay for) and remade the logo using vectors.</p>
<p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><a href="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2019/12/2019-11-09_11-35-49.jpg"><img src="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2019/12/2019-11-09_11-35-49.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="History of decaf-emu in screenshots - Part 7"></a></figure></p>
<p>And then I learned that SVG has multiple versions and it turns out one of the features I was using for the white stroke outline was not supported in the Qt SVG renderer. So I had to redo the outline again.</p>
<p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><a href="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2019/12/2019-11-09_14-07-58.png"><img src="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2019/12/2019-11-09_14-07-58.png" class="kg-image" alt="History of decaf-emu in screenshots - Part 7"></a></figure></p><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p><strong>2019-11-09</strong><br>
As you can see, I do not waste my time playing any games and instead spend it all working very hard!<br>

When working on a difficult problem sometimes it just helps to take the time to very carefully draw a visual representation to help understand your problem.</p>
<p>In this case I was working on a new implementation of RECT rendering. For background, the Wii U's GPU supports rendering of RECT primitive types - where they only give you 3 vertices and the GPU magically figures out the 4th vertex. This is not a supported primitive mode in Vulkan and must be emulated using geometry shaders.</p>
<p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><a href="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2019/12/2019-11-17_10-57-26.png"><img src="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2019/12/2019-11-17_10-57-26.png" class="kg-image" alt="History of decaf-emu in screenshots - Part 7"></a></figure></p>
<p>You can see the initial work I did on it in this commit:<br><a href="https://github.com/decaf-emu/decaf-emu/commit/baf45d318e51a74f9d43f6e2e94f6bb89d36345a">https://github.com/decaf-emu/decaf-emu/commit/baf45d318e51a74f9d43f6e2e94f6bb89d36345a</a></p>

I discovered that you can make the blocks appear in Super Mario Maker when you are placing one of these lil spikey guys. They disappear again as soon as you release the mouse button. But without context from this screenhot we can pretend the game works :).<br>

That brings us to today, sitting here writing this after yet another year has passed. The first commit to the project was in May 2015, so we are already 4.5 years in and we still cannot play 144hz 4k Zelda!! But I feel like decaf-emu is slowly but surely moving in the right direction and the most important thing is that I still enjoy working on this project, even if at times there are some very tedious problems to tackle.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there has not been many screenshots until fairly recently as I continued to dive deeper down into the rabbit holes I mentioned in the previous post and ended up completely rewriting the core of the emulator so that we have a boot process which matches similarly to the real system. This means that in decaf-emu we start by booting IOS, and then IOS MCP process boots the Cafe Kernel which in turn boots the Loader process to load the CafeOS userland. I then went on to rework the CafeOS userland such that one day we could support multiple processes, as the Wii U can have both a foreground and background process running (like when a game opens the Internet Browser), as well as a few other system ones such as the Loader or the Home Button Menu. During this process, which took over a year, I was not even able to compile my emulator let alone run a game in it.</p>

I then went on to experiment with the idea of implementing something like dolphin's FifoCI for automated testing of graphics. Unfortunately our PM4 (the communication protocol with the AMD R600 series GPUs) replay mechanism is not yet mature enough to make this tool useful so it was shelved for now. But you can see from this screenshot I had the replay dumping each frame to images, which when the tool is ready would be used to compare against previous images and automatically detect changes to notify us of regressions.</p>

This is when I seriously started work on the huge rewrite which goes on to take up a year of my life. The first step was to completely emulate the whole IOS operating system, in the previous blog I talked about doing IOS but that was only implementing IOS devices which coreinit could ioctl with. Unfortunately because of this there are not many screenshots to show between here and when I finally finished this effort.</p>

I was also working on improving <a href="https://github.com/decaf-emu/wut">wut</a> (my Wii U Toolchain for writing homebrew) alongside my work on decaf, especially as I had spent so much time reversing the real Loader I had much more knowledge of what was possible. I discovered that there was a custom relocation type which was perfect for translating R_PPC_REL32 relocations in the .elf files output by gcc into .rpx files compatible with the Wii U.</p>

Finally able to load games again, over a year after the huge rewrite begun. I love this screenshot because it represents the result of a full year of reverse engineering and programming where I could not even compile my code, let alone succesfully load a game. It also shows something I think is pretty cool, you can see see in the Memory window all our internal HLE functions, I rewrote how our HLE implementation interacts with the userland processes so that we now actually generate a .rpl file at runtime for each HLE library with its function and data exports which are then loaded by the Loader process as it would with a real .rpl. I thought this was cool, but I imagine the concept would require much more explaining to fully appreciate.</p>

I got slightly distracted and wrote a small console output library for the Wii U which supports all the things one would expect from a console. Except I never got around to adding it to wut, maybe one day. My original intention was to use it to write a fancy exception handler for wut which provided more useful information and could allow homebrew to exit gracefully upon encountering an error.</p>

<p><strong>ramblings</strong><br>
To others this may not have been the most interesting year, afterall this was the year of people proclaiming &quot;decaf is dead&quot; whilst I quietly slaved away slowly marching onwards to achieve my own personal goals. I think some people forget what these complex long-term programming projects mean to their authors, although I can only speak for myself. decaf-emu fulfills a role of artistic expression in my life and is a long term project to focus my ambitions and desires for continuous learning, exploration and self improvement. I learnt so much about the internals of the Wii U so this was probably my favourite year yet. There was some great refactoring and rewriting of the core internals of the emulator, along with many bug fixes and improvements, such that I can say I am feeling more proud of what we have achieved. Of course we still have a long way to go, but we made some amazing steps in the right direction.</p>

I updated the Windows build to also use CMake - this is great because it creates less of a maintenance nightmare. At this time both Windows devs (Brett and I) were not working on the project so any change achurch or others pushed would break the Windows build. So instead of having to maintain two separate build systems I did the obvious thing and started working on a unified CMake.<br>

With my new found knowledge of CMake I decided to port my Wii U toolchain <a href="https://github.com/decaf-emu/wut">wut</a> to CMake also, this should make it much easier to write Wii U homebrew - the old Makefiles were a confusing mess! The benefit of this for decaf-emu would be so that we could integrate test homebrew into the decaf CMake build system.<br>

One of my pet projects that I had been trying to do for a long time was to rewrite our implementation of the coreinit.rpl filesystem emulation from the ground up to be much more close to the original implementation in coreinit.rpl. This was a nightmare to reverse, especially the FS State Manager which I still don't fully understand!<br>
<a href="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/05/2017-03-13_20-44-19.png"><img src="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/05/2017-03-13_20-44-19.png" alt="History of decaf-emu in screenshots - Part 3"></a></p>
<p><strong>2017-03-21 21:06:59</strong><br>
I really jumped down the rabbit hole when rewriting the filesystem - I ended up reversing it all the way to the IOS layer where it communicates over IPC with the ARM chip in the Wii U. This is actually a very important change, having IOS emulation is great as it allows for some exciting stuff in the future. For example many system libraries use the IOS to communicate with hardware devices, this means we would be able to do cool stuff like USB or Bluetooth passthrough for supporting peripherals such as Wii motes. It also opens the door for low level emulation of system libraries which rely on IOS.<br>
<a href="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/05/2017-03-21_21-06-59.png"><img src="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/05/2017-03-21_21-06-59.png" alt="History of decaf-emu in screenshots - Part 3"></a></p>
<p><strong>2017-03-22 22:12:36</strong><br>
The actual control flow of a filesystem operation is quite complex - that's why writing good comments is useful. I'd never remember this if I came back to it later without a written explanation.<br>
<a href="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/05/2017-03-22_22-12-36.png"><img src="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/05/2017-03-22_22-12-36.png" alt="History of decaf-emu in screenshots - Part 3"></a></p>
<p><strong>2017-03-23 00:43:03</strong><br>
The new filesystem with IOS IPC works - that complicated control flow which spans multiple threads and interrupts as seen in the previous screenshot actually all works!<br>

<p><strong>2017-03-24 17:34:10</strong><br>
Obviously this meant I had to rewrite every single filesystem command, with reversing the serialisation to the IOS IPC buffers and then implementing the command over in the IOS FSA driver. There's a lot of commands!<br>

At the same time I was also trying to help <a href="https://github.com/achurch">achurch</a> with debugging the last remaining issues in his amazing new JIT that he wrote for decaf-emu, <a href="https://bitbucket.org/achurch_/libbinrec">libbinrec</a>. It's an incredible effort, it decompiles PPC to an internal representation then performs optimisation passes over to generate some beautifully optimised x64. I was very impressed by the comprehensive test suite he wrote for his new library, there was 3296 of them!<br>

<p><strong>2017-04-03 21:40:08</strong><br>
One last thing I wanted to make sure worked before merging the JIT was debugging. I modified our breakpoints to write actual trap instructions and then invalidate the JIT code cache in the region the breakpoint was placed. So that when the JIT recompiles the function it will see the tw and emit a handler which processes the breakpoint and returns control to the debugger. The debugger will fall back to the interpreter for stepping through instructions, or when properly resumed will continue with the JIT.<br>

I decided to start playing around with low level emulation of system libraries. Previously we had to reimplement every single library by hand in C++ function by function, which is a slow and tedious process. It is also would be a very bad approach in the long term, for example some system libraries are simply drivers around USB devices. Now that we have IOS support it would be much better to allow USB passthrough to these LLE libraries rather than have to implement our own USB drivers! The LLE approach is only suitable for non performance critical libraries, and for any library which does not directly use MMIO. This would exclude the important libraries, coreinit, gx2 and snd_core. For example however, erreula.rpl is a great candidate - it's a system library which sole purpose is to display error messages on the screen, and now by LLEing it Bit Trip Runner 2 the game now shows an error message instead of a black screen:<br>

<p><strong>2017-04-05 10:51:11</strong><br>
I tried playing around with LLE of swkbd.rpl, and now the Wii U system keyboard almost works in Xenoblade. There is lower level functionality it relies on which I did not implement yet so it's not useable but it's another great candidate for LLE. It's also cool to see the real Wii U keyboard in decaf-emu!<br>

A big part of emulation is figuring out the system internals, I finally got around to writing a much nicer RPC server/client for the Wii U which lets me easily prod at Wii U functions from python. Thanks to all the recent strides in Wii U homebrew it's much easier now than it is before, no more messing around with browser exploits, I can simply compile a .rpx using my toolchain, upload it to my console via FTP, and run it from <a href="https://github.com/dimok789/homebrew_launcher">homebrew launcher</a>!<br>

My IOS IPC reversing days are far from over, after figuring out the IOS device /dev/fsa for the filesystem, I now moved onto reversing /dev/mcp for the MCP_ family of functions. These were much harder to reverse but I have made some progress. MCP is responsible for title management (installed games, patches and DLC).<br>

After reworking the debugger for the new JIT and trying to debug some issues for some games, I found myself cross referencing our debugger and the same code in IDA, so i thought why not merge the two and expose decaf-emu's debugger as  GDB stub which IDA can connect to. Hopefully this will be useful for some people, but I also found it rewarding because it allowed me to clean up all the debugger code which I have wanted to refactor for a long time!<br>

I finally started looking into the issue with the new Zelda title, an allocation was failing due to us not providing the game with enough memory. A simple hack is to increase the memory available to games, but that is not the correct approach. I ended up rewriting the whole virtual memory management and physical memory mapping from scratch to now be much more accurate with how a real console works. In line with my low level IOS work I've been doing lately I decided to jump down that rabbit hole once again. I ended up implementing the virtual memory stuff as kernel syscalls as they are on the console, and used my new python RPC tool to prod at the actual virtual memory map on the console to reproduce the same mappings in decaf. Then I decided to re-evaluate our approach to accessing virtual memory from HLE code and ended up trying to write a much safer way of using it which is what is shown in this screenshot. Sorry for  those people who don't know C++ ;D.<br>

After unifying the test building, I can now use CTest to actually execute the tests. A great step forward for automated testing of the emulator, now we just need to write thousands of tests... simple! And also write a framework to get these tests running automated on console so we can match up results to verify behaviour.<br>

Playing around with a POC of a Qt based PM4 graphical debugger tool. This tool would allow you to inspect the state of the latte GPU and would function similar to how graphical debuggers work for OpenGL / DirectX etc. This is a significant amount of work however, and I'm not sure how valuable the gains are, I feel effort is better spent in gx2 unit tests and hardware testing.<br>

Another prime example of games with full function symbols included being very useful in the development process. Here I was working on a library for <a href="https://github.com/decaf-emu/wut">wut</a> to allow easy loading of GFD files (which are files that can store shaders and textures). This is the first step towards easier use of GX2 from homebrew (and more importantly, graphical tests for decaf!).<br>

<p><strong>Future</strong><br>
So what's the future of decaf-emu going to look like? At this point our weakest area is the GPU emulation, so most of my ideas are around that. Some of the things I have been thinking about are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix the mysterious file system bug - ever since I rewrote the file system several games are failing in file system related functions for no apparent reason. Including most (all?) Unity engine games (Meme Run!!!), also seen in sound loading functions for several games which presumably are sharing the same library code.</li>
<li>Improve PM4 replay recording - fix texture size bug (<a href="https://github.com/decaf-emu/decaf-emu/commit/2479b37ff698996d807f64d28b691ae88b1b60d0">now fixed</a>), reduce file size of replays by supporting memory diffs.</li>
<li>PM4 replay GUI.</li>
<li>Vulkan graphics backend - it's good to write a new backend from scratch using the knowledge we've gained, hopefully it will clean out some of the organically grown mess from the GL backend.</li>
<li>latte shader assembler, super important for homebrew and for GX2 tests.</li>
<li>GX2 graphics unit tests, with results dumped from console to compare to decaf.</li>
<li>Something like dolphin's FifoCI using our PM4 replay tool.</li>
<li>Improve the interface between gx2.rpl and our GPU emulation. This involves another one of those low level rabbit holes I seem to enjoy diving down lately. More accurate emulation of the GPU ringbuffer control via tcl.rpl, and hardware display control via dc.rpl and avm.rpl.</li>
<li>More code documentation!</li>
<li>More HLE unit tests.</li>
<li>Framework for running HLE unit tests on console and comparing results with decaf-emu.</li>
<li>Figure out ways to improve the development infrastructure to help new and existing developers.</li>
</ul>

A game brought to my attention by a friendly youtube emulator tester <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pcmaker2">JohnGodGames / pcmaker</a>. He was very helpful during this time of development regularly testing updates and providing us with logs from his huge collection of games so we could fix issues.<br>

<p><strong>2015-05-18 19:58:18</strong><br>
decaf-emu (or wiiu-emu as it was known back then) started as a simple file loader for the Wii U .rpx files<br>
<a href="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2015-05-18_19-58-18.png"><img src="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2015-05-18_19-58-18.png" alt="History of decaf-emu in screenshots - Part 1"></a></p>

We are now 2 months in and from this screenshot you can see we already have our first fiber based thread scheduler and quite a few coreinit functions implemented (and I presume a pretty solid PPC interpreter if we are getting this far).<br>

Seems like we figured out how texture storage &quot;works&quot; (we are yet to have many problems with the peculiarities of GPU texture swizzling!).<br>

<p><strong>2015-10-28 20:15:53</strong><br>
This was the first game running in the emulator, if you look hard enough you might be able to tell this is actually NES Remix. Looks like we've switched to the name decaf here.<br>

So we're now 5 months in and we have something which looks like a game! Awesome! Except it's totally wrong and we're going to redo all the graphics from scratch again, great!<br>

<p><strong>2015-11-11 22:25:39</strong><br>
In November we decided to move to using PM4 for encoding our GPU instructions just as the real Wii U does. PM4 is the data format that the AMD gpu uses to communicate with the graphics drivers running on the CPU.</p>

Once we started gaining some interest from the outside world we decided to switch to OpenGL in an attempt to attract Linux developers to the project. So we're back to being unable to render Amiibo Settings correctly.<br>
<a href="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2015-11-23_17-51-38.png"><img src="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2015-11-23_17-51-38.png" alt="History of decaf-emu in screenshots - Part 1"></a></p>

<p><strong>2015-11-26 17:38:37</strong><br>
It didn't take that long to get back to where we were before with the old DX12 renderer. But now we were using OpenGL with our much more accurate PM4 pipeline for feeding commands to the GPU instead of a custom format!<br>
<a href="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2015-11-26_17-38-37.png"><img src="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2015-11-26_17-38-37.png" alt="History of decaf-emu in screenshots - Part 1"></a></p>

<p><strong>2015-12-02 15:34:24</strong><br>
With the Wii U we were fortunate enough to have games compiled with full function symbols which made some things easier to reverse!<br>
<a href="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2015-12-02_15-34-24.png"><img src="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2015-12-02_15-34-24.png" alt="History of decaf-emu in screenshots - Part 1"></a></p>

<p><strong>2015-12-19 14:13:30</strong><br>
But two steps forward! A second game running in the emulator, I believe this is one of the Mario games.<br>

<p><strong>2015-12-20 15:18:28</strong><br>
Oh yeah it's Super Mario 3D World.<br>

<p>So it's about 7 months after we started, we've made some progress, but it's a long time to work on stuff without any playable results and we're a bit burnt out so we both took a break.</p>

Fast forward several years and suddenly one day I receive a message from <a href="https://github.com/brett19">Brett Lawson</a> saying he wants to try make a ROSE client in the browser with WebGL and three.js, after some discussion we got a bit carried away and suddenly it's 30 days later and we've barely slept, but we actually came up with something pretty impressive.</p>
<p>The source code for this project is available on github: <a href="https://github.com/brett19/rosebrowser">https://github.com/brett19/rosebrowser</a></p>
<p>All the screenshots and their timestamps come from both of our puu.sh accounts.</p>
<p><strong>2014-09-15 02:54:55</strong><br>
It all started on the 15th September 2014 at 02:54:55am, where we rendered a simple heightmap and tileset.<br>
<a href="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2014-09-15_02-54-55.jpg"><img src="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2014-09-15_02-54-55.jpg" alt="ROSE Online in the browser"></a></p>
<p><strong>2014-09-15 02:55:39</strong><br>
10 minutes later we could render a full map with the correct tilemap.<br>
<a href="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2014-09-15_02-55-39.jpg"><img src="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2014-09-15_02-55-39.jpg" alt="ROSE Online in the browser"></a></p>
<p><strong>2014-09-15 03:43:35</strong><br>
About 50 minutes later we could render the static objects on a map too... In roughly 1h30m we managed to go from nothing to this:<br>

<p><strong>2014-09-16 03:37:11</strong><br>
Starting on rendering NPCs.<br>

<p><strong>2014-09-17 02:08:07</strong><br>
We have some basic character rendering started. It's possible we have a network connection to the server here too as this is a character standing on the character select map.<br>

<p><strong>2014-09-17 04:12:19</strong><br>
Trying to get lightmaps working here.<br>
<a href="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2014-09-17_04-12-19.jpg"><img src="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2014-09-17_04-12-19.jpg" alt="ROSE Online in the browser"></a></p>
<p><strong>2014-09-19 02:44L04</strong><br>
Looking pretty amazing with lightmaps!<br>
<a href="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2014-09-19_2-44-04.png"><img src="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2014-09-19_2-44-04.png" alt="ROSE Online in the browser"></a></p>
<p><strong>2014-09-19 10:21:49</strong><br>
4 days in to the project now and we have the map rendering with full lightmaps and water rendering<br>
<a href="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2014-09-19_10-21-49--2-.jpg"><img src="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2014-09-19_10-21-49--2-.jpg" alt="ROSE Online in the browser"></a></p>
<p><strong>2014-09-21 06:04:42</strong><br>
After only 6 days we were able to get in game, move around, and see other players.<br>
<a href="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2014-09-21_06-04-42.jpg"><img src="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2014-09-21_06-04-42.jpg" alt="ROSE Online in the browser"></a></p>
<p><strong>2014-09-21 06:23:40</strong><br>
However we clearly still had some rendering issues.<br>
<a href="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2014-09-21_06-23-40.jpg"><img src="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2014-09-21_06-23-40.jpg" alt="ROSE Online in the browser"></a></p>
<p><strong>2014-09-23 01:27:00</strong><br>
Then our attention turned to particle effects, after 1-2 days of work we had particle effects working, parsing from the .PTL and .EFT files.<br>
<a href="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2014-09-23_01-27-00.jpg"><img src="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2014-09-23_01-27-00.jpg" alt="ROSE Online in the browser"></a></p>
<p><strong>2014-09-23 08:04:37</strong><br>
Looks like we fixed an error with tilemaps here.<br>

<p><strong>2014-09-28 04:19:42</strong><br>
Getting monsters rendering!<br>

<p><strong>2014-09-29 02:25:22</strong><br>
Time to get started on a user interface.<br>
<a href="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2014-09-29_02-25-22.jpg"><img src="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2014-09-29_02-25-22.jpg" alt="ROSE Online in the browser"></a></p>
<p><strong>2014-09-29 02:31:25</strong><br>
And time to focus on playability, this was our first properly functioning character select screen.<br>
<a href="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2014-09-29_02-31-25.jpg"><img src="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2014-09-29_02-31-25.jpg" alt="ROSE Online in the browser"></a></p>
<p><strong>2014-09-29 02:32:26</strong><br>
Conversations with NPCs were based off local .CON files, which referenced strings in .STL files.<br>
<a href="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2014-09-29_02-32-26.jpg"><img src="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2014-09-29_02-32-26.jpg" alt="ROSE Online in the browser"></a></p>
<p><strong>2014-09-29 02:36:25</strong><br>
They also relied on .QSD files to allow for conditions / actions to happen to decide what text to show you or what action to take on clicking text.<br>

<p><strong>2014-10-03 03:48:04</strong><br>
So less than 3 weeks have passed and we have something resembling a functional client...<br>
<a href="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2014-10-03_03-48-04.jpg"><img src="https://exjam.github.io/content/images/2017/04/2014-10-03_03-48-04.jpg" alt="ROSE Online in the browser"></a></p>
<p><strong>2014-10-03 03:48:37</strong><br>
It still has it's entertaining bugs though, we used a downwards raycast to calculate where to place an NPC, except this one is meant to stand under a tent...<br>

Entertaining bug #2.<br>

<p><strong>2014-10-03 06:38:50</strong><br>
Basic attempt at in game combat.<br>

<p><strong>2014-10-04 01:27:58</strong><br>
Now we had combat in the game, I really wanted to get the client into a position where we could complete the first quest line to get access to your profession, here's the Quest UI which shows your progression along your active quests.<br>

<p><strong>2014-10-04 01-57-40</strong><br>
Getting pretty excited here, I am able to progress along the job quest, kill the flowers and take their precious seeds!<br>

Ahhh after some hardcore grinding I'm about to complete the job quest and get my job!<br>

What other features does an MMO client need? Parties! Now i can finally send Brett abusive messages in private (and we completed a job quest together!)<br>

It's been a month and we made some amazing progress, but after working on it all day every day we just got burnt out. Here was one of the last screenshots I made before we stopped, it's the first screen you see when you open your browser.<br>
